# webTaskMaster: Learn how much time do you spend on which web page - an extension for Mozilla Firefox

This plug-in is developed using the Firefox
[Jetpack](https://jetpack.mozillalabs.com/) technology and helps
Firefox users to easily see how much daily time they spend on which web pages.

## Description

If you want to run this Jetpack extension simply visit
webTaskTimer.html with your Firefox (I'm yet to host this system
somewhere). You'll see a Install... button on the top right corner of
the Firefox. If you click on it the extension will be installed (and
no need to restart your browser).

That's all. Once you install it the extension will start to measure
how much time you spend on which page and if you want to see the
results just click on the blue arrow on the top left corner of your tab bar.
